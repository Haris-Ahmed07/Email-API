Email API using JavaMail and Spring Framework

This Email API is a simple Java application built using the Spring Framework and JavaMail API to send emails using a Gmail SMTP server. It provides a convenient way to send emails programmatically from your Java applications.

Prerequisites
Before using this Email API, ensure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
A Gmail account to use as the sender for your emails.
Setup
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).

Update the following information in the EmailService class:

Replace "from@gmail.com" with the Gmail email address you'll be using as the sender.
Replace "pass" with the password for the Gmail account.
Ensure that your Gmail account settings allow "Less Secure Apps" to access your account. If you have two-step verification enabled, generate an "App Password" for the application.

Usage
In your application code, import the EmailService class from the package com.emailapi.services.

Create an instance of the EmailService class.

Call the sendEmail method with the recipient's email address, subject, and message body.

import com.emailapi.services.EmailService;

public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmailService emailService = new EmailService();
        
        String to = "recipient@example.com";
        String from = "from@gmail.com";
        String subject = "Hello from Email API";
        String message = "This is a test email sent using the Email API.";
        
        emailService.sendEmail(to, from, subject, message);
    }
}
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using this Email API, consider the following:

Double-check the sender's email address and password in the EmailService class.
Ensure that your Gmail account settings allow "Less Secure Apps" or generate an "App Password" if you have two-step verification enabled.
Check your internet connection and firewall settings to ensure that the application can communicate with the Gmail SMTP server.
